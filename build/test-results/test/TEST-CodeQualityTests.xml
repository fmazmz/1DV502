1 FindBugs Issues in assignmenttwo/solarsystem/Moon.java
text:lines: 19-57 
Exception thrown in class assignmenttwo.solarsystem.Moon at new 
  assignmenttwo.solarsystem.Moon(String, int, double) will leave the constructor. The object under 
  construction remains partially initialized and may be vulnerable to Finalizer attacks. 
Be wary of letting constructors throw exceptions. 
Classes that throw exceptions in their constructors are vulnerable to Finalizer attacks 
 
A finalizer attack can be prevented, by declaring the class final, using an empty finalizer declared 
  as final, or by a clever use of a private constructor. 
 
See SEI CERT Rule OBJ-11 for more information.
